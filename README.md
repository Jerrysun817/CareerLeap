# CareerLeap: connecting job seekers who have disabilities to employers and mentors
#### Submitted to HackCamp 2022
#### üèÜ Most Innovative Project among 26 submissions

## Inspiration

People with disabilities are often not considered potential members of the workforce. According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, over 400,000 Canadians with disabilities are currently unemployed even though they are able and willing to work. As yet, access to effective employment support is limited. 

## What CareerLeap does

CareerLeap is a networking platform that connects job seekers with disabilities looking for a job in skills trades with either an employer or a peer who is employed. Job seekers have the option to connect with someone with a disability if they prefer. When you open the home page, all registered mentors are displayed with their basic information (location and job) and buttons that are linked to their LinkedIn and email addresses. You can filter the mentors shown by going to the FilterBy page where you can filter whether they have a disability or not and the type of skills trades career. We hope this website would break down barriers to employment for people with disabilities.

## Building Process
We built the website using React, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML and the design prototype using Figma. 

## Challenges
- Learning React and Figma for the first time
- Programming the filter function
- Editing the profile layout but using flexbox helped solve this issue

## What‚Äôs next for CareerLeap
We would like to improve accessibility by implementing an enlarge text size function and allowing users to navigate the site via a keyboard. We also hope to create a chat feature to allow mentees to connect with mentors more easily and build a recommendation system.
